IDEAS:

course is measured in kilometers
time is measured in seconds

max power * effort = desired power
fatigue (fuel remaining) affects power output
acceleration determines how fast your power ramps up

once you're out of fuel, your power drops to the "recover rate" level

sprinters vs. climbers?
sprinter = high max power, slow recovery
climber = lower max power, higher recovery
tt = high-ish max power, good recovery

overnight recovery?

SCENARIOS:

flat time trial: for TT victors
sprint finish
straight climb
rolling course

"To win the Tour de France you need to be able to hold 5.9 to 6.0 watts per kg for 30 to 45 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times over the course of a 5 to 6 hour day in the mountains." -- cyclingtips.com

// DONE: calculate more precise finishing time (ie, not rounded to 10 seconds)
// DONE: power curves for each rider
// DONE: climbing ability versus flat ability
// DONE: distance from power
// DONE: descending speed accurate? [seems close]
// DONE: downhill shouldn't use as much energy [works as part of the standard power equation; just don't set effort to 0]
// DONE: rolling course tests
// DONE: slowing down, not stopping immediately, when out of energy [averages last speed]
// DONE: sprinting power may need to be re-thought since the step size is 10 seconds (that's too long to be considered "accelerating" to 1600 watts if that only lasts 2 seconds) [1 second intervals now]
// DONE: come up with a starting fuel tank number [based on FTP minus recovery rate]
// DONE: implement and test descending ability
// DONE: negative energy is slower to recover
// DONE: bonk recovery
// DONE: group tests
// DONE: need group power or speed setting (varies per leader!)
// DONE: fatigue? bonking penalty? [negative fuel = slow to recover; fatigue can be reduced power below 20%]
